# Getting Started with Create React App
 To execute dummy authentication using api given at https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth

Make a login UI and a profile page, the login takes only username and password and has a login button.

The task is to take the username and password from the user
 and then on click of the log in button send a post request at the api given in the link above.
The post request should look like this -
fetch('https://dummyjson.com/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username:${usernameState},
    password:${passwordState},
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(console.log); </li>
If the response is 200 OK, then save the entire user object including token 
and the id in local storage and send the user to profile page.
Inside the profile page , make a useEffect which sends a fetch request
 at https://dummyjson.com/users/${id} , where id is the id you saved in the local storage
Save the user object with all the details using local storage again and display all of the information you receive.
Use any one of the usernames and passwords given below to actually log in and get a successful response, if the response is not 200 OK or successful then show the error provided by the api in the frontend on login.
Dummy Credentials to get a successful response - Username - atuny0 , Password - 9uQFF1Lh
Username - hbingley1 , password - CQutx25i8r
Username - rshawe2 , password - OWsTbMUgFc
You can get more valid usernames and password from - https://dummyjson.com/users.
If its an invalid username or password the login api will automatically show an error.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
